#THIS COPY OF THE STATA COMMANDS IS PRESET TO OUR OWN INDEX YEAR AND LOOKBACK PERIOD


#This is an edited version of AKI discrete episode code as previously described in AJKD.
#The orginal version included multiple different definitions using different look-backs, look-forwards, approaches to #ranking baseline values
#This code cannot be applied directly to the current NHSE AKI warning algorithm, because the use here of a 8-90-365 hierarchical #criterion results in different categorisations.
#Lab reported MDRD eGFR is used to define baseline, modules are also included to derive this from MDRD or CKD-EPI
#This code requires pre-installation of the following R packages:

library(taRifx)
library (dplyr)

#PART 0 - INITIAL VARIABLE CHECKLIST

#studyid = unique id number for patient
#dos = date of sample
#stcreat = idms standardised creatinine
#mdrd = mdrd eGFR
#sex = male=1 female=0
#age = age in years at time of sample
#location_code = inpatient or outpatient sample
#Ensure input table columns are ordered as above

#PLEASE ENSURE THAT THE FILE CONTAINS ONLY STANDARDISED SERUM/BLOOD CREATININE RESULTS (NO OTHER BIOCHEMISTRY) 
#ALSO CHECK THAT ALL SAMPLES AFTER PATIENTS HAVE STARTED RRT/RECEIVED A TRANSPLANT HAVE BEEN REMOVED

# PART 1 - CHECK AND ORGANISE VARIABLES
#This section ensures dates are recognised by R
#destrings numeric variables
#Based on studying the highest creatinine each day considering low reliability of time stamps

#This has been coded here as the lowest in last 7 days, or the median in 90 days if that is lower, or the median in one year if there were no 90 day tests and the one year is lower than the one week reference.
#This level of detail seems rarely to be reported in studies, but can greatly affect how AKI patients are staged.
#I would WARN that the date for reference creatinine is PRETTY MEANINGLESS given that a median is taken for longer lookbacks. 
#If for some reason you need a date for ref (but better not to use - I would question the relevance), I have previously used the later date where an average of two middle tests is required to produce the median creatinine.
